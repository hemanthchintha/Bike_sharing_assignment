## General Information
- programming assignment on bike sharing data
- Predicting the demand of shared bikes.
- dataset is provided by the bike sharing organisatioin.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion on EDA of categorical variable: Thre is positive trend in count of bikes in season,year,month holiday
- Conclusion on EDA of continuous variable:  Temp has high correlation with count of bikes.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis : year ,season and month is contributing significatly towards predicting the demand of bikes
